aulab-soundflower-equalizer-toggle
==================================

This AppleScript toggles an AU Lab.app '.trak' file and soundflower 2ch output sound settings.

#Directions
1) Download and install [AU Lab](https://www.apple.com/itunes/mastered-for-itunes/) and [Soundflower](https://code.google.com/p/soundflower/) (restart required)

2) place the SexyAudioEqualizer.trak file in your Documents directory

3) open 'equalizer-toggle.scpt' file with AppleScript Editor.app and replace YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE with your OSX user name

4) Save script as "Equalizer Toggle.app" in your Applications folder and attempt to run it (OSX 10.9.5 Mavericks will throw a security alert)

5) Give permission for the app to run in: Sysytem Preferences -> Security & Privacy --> Privacy --> Accessibility

#How it works
This application is a toggle. Run the app to turn on the equalizer settings in AU Lab and set your sound ouput settings to Soundflower (2ch). Run it again to reset your sound output settings to "Headphones" and quit AU Lab. I recommend using Alfred or Quicksilver for quick access. Enjoy :)
